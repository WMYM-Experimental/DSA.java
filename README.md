## Data Structures

Are the programmetic way of storing data **in  memory space** so that data can be used efficiently.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure
- **Time Complexity**: Running time or execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
- **Correctness**: Data Structure implementation should implement its interface correctly. (In Java)

## Important Data Structures
- Array / Multidimentional Array
- Stack
- Queue
- List
- Linked list
- Hash Table
