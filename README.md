## Data Structures

Are the programmatic way of storing data **in  memory space** so that data can be used efficiently.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure:
- **Time Complexity**: Running time or execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
- **Correctness**: Data Structure implementation should implement its interface correctly. (In Java)

### Type of DS:

- Linear
- Non Linear

## Important Data Structures:

- **Singly Linked List**
- **Double Linked List**
- **Array**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Binary Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Matrix**

## Leetcode

I will solve some problems of leetcode in java.

## Project Euler

The same way am going to solve the leetcode problems i'll do with the project euler problems.
